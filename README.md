# colonist.io-interaction

In order to interact with bots on colonist.io, we wrote a Python script which utilizes the packages pyppeteer and asyncio to extract WebSocket messages from an ongoing game on colonist.io.

We modified the JSettlers build to accept input files which include the initial game setup of the colonist.io. These input files are generated by our script when a colonist.io game starts. Then, the script awaits WebSocket messages that describe initial placement of the colonist.io bots, and uses the packages pywinauto and pyautogui to input these initial placements for each "human" player (we create three human players, one robot, and one spectator in JSettlers). When the JSettlers robot does its initial placements, we manually input those into colonist.io so that the colonist.io bots can finish their placements (order changes game to game).

From there, all players become JSettlers robots so that we can evaluate their initial placement equally after the game concludes.
